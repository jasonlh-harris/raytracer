//! Ray Intersection testing library

//! The libRayIntersection library provides classes to support ray intersection
//! tests with triangles and polygons. 
//!
//! The libRayIntersection libary is available from 
//! <a href="https://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse472/secure/rayintersection.zip">
//! rayintersection.zip</a>
//! 
//! To use:
//!
//! -# Call Initialize() to initialize the system.
//! -# Call Material() to set a pointer to the current material property
//! -# Call Texture() to set a pointer to the current texture (optional)
//! -# Add polygons or triangles to the system:
//!     -# Call PolygonBegin() or TriangleBegin()
//!     -# Call Vertex() to add vertices for the polygon
//!     -# Call Normal() to specify a normal for the polygon
//!     -# Call TexVertex() to specify a vertex for the polygon
//!     -# Call PolygonEnd() or TriangleEnd()
//! -# Call LoadingComplete()
//! -# Call Intersect() to test for intersections
//! -# Call IntersectInfo() to get intersection information for rendering
//!
//! Notice:  CRayIntersection is NOT thread safe. Do not use with more than one
//! thread. An easy way to support multithreading is to create a separate copy of
//! the class for each thread.
